# City of Heroes Android

The selected baseline is the **original OuroDev-derived source import** from
`Thunderspies/CityOfHeroes`, at commit
`0b75ade0c801735e10c5798f641948a45cc50488`. It includes local server services,
the graphical client and development tools. It is Issue 24/Volume 2 lineage
with downstream changes: source code, not a VM image.

**Validation, 2026-09-25:** all 5,995 imported files pass integrity checks. An
[upstream Windows build of this exact commit](https://github.com/Thunderspies/CityOfHeroes/actions/runs/35934567567)
built the server and client and passed nine utility, archive and codec tests.
Gameplay and Android execution have not been validated.

The complete pinned companion data is now imported under `upstream/i24`: **156,297
files, 1,992,097,492 bytes**, verified against its original Git tree. Runtime
staging tools preserve both snapshots and fix the companion executable-name gap.

The current [matching Windows client/server package](https://github.com/Russianranger/coh-android/actions/runs/36088012664)
passes its hosted build and dependency checks. The supplied base assets have been
assembled with the pinned text: **173,011 data files**, including **16,721 binary
assets**. See the [reference runtime and downloads](docs/REFERENCE_RUNTIME.md).

The current [data-only schema generation](https://github.com/Russianranger/coh-android/actions/runs/36088012666)
also passed, producing all 56 expected files with stable attribute mappings and
zero queued errors. It shares repository commit
`775a0dd770adac045484805dbbb5f68054c7a354` with the reference package.
The [PostgreSQL regression suite](https://github.com/Russianranger/coh-android/actions/runs/36088012670)
passed all four jobs, including 21 real-DbServer persistence check groups.
The [normal fixture-OFF DbServer startup/export/reload check](https://github.com/Russianranger/coh-android/actions/runs/36125829298)
also passed with generated game schemas: 99 tables, 5,935 columns, 58,272 attribute rows,
stable catalog and identifier mappings, and no failure diagnostics across both
passes against a fresh disposable PostgreSQL database.

The [real network save test](https://github.com/Russianranger/coh-android/actions/runs/36125829311)
also passed: normal DbServer/MapServer requests, acknowledgements held until a
blocked two-container save committed, and no acknowledgement after an injected
commit failure. The failed save preserved the previous row and stopped DbServer.
This exercises generic containers; character persistence remains a separate gate.

The repository is **not a complete runnable installation**. Comparison with
asset-complete template generation, runtime cache generation, map startup and
character creation/save/reload remain open. Supplied asset archives are staged
separately from Git; their offline checks do not establish that every runtime
dependency is present. Gameplay, Android execution and complete serializer
equivalence remain unvalidated.

The goal remains an Android app running a local server and matching client on
the AYN Thor. The user has no Windows PC: use hosted Windows builds/reference
tests and Thor gameplay testing. There is no Android APK yet.

The i25 investigation is now a [deferred alternative](docs/I25_SOURCE_ACQUISITION.md).
OuroDev access and the `odtoken` secret are not required for this public snapshot.
