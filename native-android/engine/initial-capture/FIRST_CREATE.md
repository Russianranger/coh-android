# Initial ALLENTS first-create observation

The physical Combined 0.1.9 Thor reports prove initial packet receipt, not a
complete character transaction. The standalone report records INITIAL_OBSERVED;
the ZIP's later CLOSED state preserves the observation and verifies two owned
sockets closed. Their raw packet body was deliberately not retained.

The Combined diagnostic observer now calls `coh_initial_create_probe` during
the exact synchronous ALLENTS loan, using its actual shortcut schema and owned
selected DBID. It reparses the header from the **post-command** cursor, then
decodes the first delta and the complete original `entSendCreate` block using
existing native parsers. No second create grammar or speculative dictionary
generation is introduced. Default production Map/Local/replication sources and
Combined 0.1.9 imports, version, signing, saves and profiles are unchanged.

The numeric `world_handoff.first_create` report retains header/create end bits,
the first failing stage/cursor, entity index/type, self flag and raw self DBID
comparison. No name, DBID, entity ID, packet pointer or packet bytes are retained.
Before observation the report is null. A complete create normally reports
`UNSUPPORTED / FIRST_RECORD_BODY_REQUIRED`. Truncated/malformed input or an
unsupported header/profile reports its own earlier boundary. This syntax result
is separate from successful raw capture and never creates a transport failure.
The next record cannot be located until the current record's body is decoded.
No scan, skip, application ACK or gameplay publication occurs.

The next bounded body stage is now composed in that same loan. After a fully
validated create, `coh_initial_pose_probe` reads the rare flags, mode, absolute
position and complete quaternion. It reuses fresh position/orientation parsers
with the **actual transport message ID**, not a fabricated dictionary generation
or previous actor baseline. The original full-create profile requires all three
rare flags, a mode update, position mask7 and quaternion mask7; partial profiles
refuse. A zero mode is valid. Create position has no interpolation-extra bit.

`world_handoff.first_record_pose` reports numeric stage/end-bit observations
separately from the preserved create result. Successful pose inspection stops
at `UNSUPPORTED / FIRST_SEQUENCE_BODY_REQUIRED`; if the packet ends exactly
there, the pose remains validated and that missing next body reports INVALID.
It retains no coordinates, quaternion, mode value, packet ID or borrowed pointer.
Neither this stage nor its ordering stamps establish character/session ownership.
An unvalidated create leaves the pose report null. A missing transport ID
is explicitly reported as an INPUT refusal rather than replaced with a constant.

After that pose boundary validates, `coh_initial_sequence_probe` now reads the
same loan at `pose_end_bit`. It requires the initial movement-update flag, then
consumes optional Pack8 movement index, optional Pack4 timing and optional
11-bit movement flags. Rounded byte-aligned fields are width checked. It
preserves the existing consumer bounds of INT32_MAX for index and 65535 for
timing; absent optional fields are legitimate zero values.

The new numeric `world_handoff.first_record_sequence` projection retains only
offsets, presence and validation status. No movement index, timing, flags,
sequence/resource identity or packet pointer survives. Successful syntax stops
before triggered moves at `UNSUPPORTED / FIRST_TRIGGERED_MOVES_REQUIRED`; if no
following bits exist, sequence validation remains true but that next boundary
reports INVALID. Unvalidated create/pose prefixes leave the sequence report null.
This raw sequence observation neither resolves animation resources nor applies
character/actor state, packet ordering, an ACK or any authority.

The next exact-loan stage, `coh_initial_triggered_probe`, now starts at the
validated `sequence_end_bit`. It reads Pack1 count, then each Pack10 index,
Pack6 delayed timing and Boolean/optional Pack16 FX ID. Zero entries are valid,
including the original `set_triggered_moves` branch. The existing native cap16
is preserved although original `MAX_TRIGGEREDMOVES` is20; count17+ reports LIMIT
at this deliberately narrower profile boundary. Index/timing keep signed32
bounds; optional FX retains the fullU32 wire domain. Pack widths are minima,
not scalar maxima, and rounded compressed Booleans must still be0 or1.

`world_handoff.first_record_triggered_moves` retains only count, complete-entry
progress, end bits and the first failing stage/entry. Partial records do not
increment complete-entry progress. No entry values, FX/resource identities or
event/actor state are retained or applied. Successful syntax stops before the
AI-animation outer flag at `UNSUPPORTED / FIRST_AI_ANIMATION_REQUIRED`; no next
bits reports INVALID there with completed-list diagnostics preserved. An
unvalidated sequence leaves this report null. No animation string is read.

## Original protocol evidence

In `upstream/ouroboros/MapServer/src/entity/entsend.c`, `entSendUpdate` initializes
the previous index to -1; `sendEntity` writes the signed delta as U32 and the
create bit before `entSendCreate`. The whole create producer writes its end flag,
entity ID/type, optional self/access/DBID, pet metadata, class/origin indices,
strings, seed and contact metadata. The visible list can precede the fallback
self send: the first entity need not be the selected character. Canonical list
termination is delta0/create1/end1. Byte-aligned booleans must still be 0 or 1.
`Game/src/entity/entrecv.c:entReceiveUpdate` confirms the enclosing source order.

The pose section is the unchanged original `entSendModes`, `entSendPosUpdate`
and `entSendQrotUpdate` calls at `entsend.c:3555..3565`, after the rare flags.
The create/full-update branch forces mode transmission and position/quaternion
masks7. The pose probe preserves its boundary before `entSendSeqMoveUpdate`;
the separate sequence probe now consumes that next leaf. Native validation mirrors the full-create invariants already used
by the private selected-record kernel without its later dictionary prerequisites.

`entSendSeqMoveUpdate` at `entsend.c:2582` and its original Game consumer agree
on update/optional-index/optional-timing/optional-movement order, with
`NEXTMOVEBIT_COUNT=11`. Full-create forces movement update1. The next medium-rare
call is `entSendSeqTriggeredMoves`, now handled by its separate bounded probe. Original server
`Entity.net_move_change_time` is U8; the original consumer receives U16. Fixtures
above255 therefore qualify the established consumer range only and must not be
claimed as representable original server object state. The bounded fixture
stance shells likewise do not establish live power/animation lookup or ownership.

`entSendSeqTriggeredMoves` at `entsend.c:2655..2684` and the corresponding Game
consumer use the same count/index/timing/FX order. The original producer adds a
delay clamped to0..15 only without FX, and uses zero added delay with FX. Its
timing expression converts through F32; original-producer high-timing fixtures
use safe representable values. INT32_MAX timing and overflow endpoints are
synthetic wire controls, avoiding out-of-range source float-to-int conversion.
The immediately following source call is `entSendAiAnimList`, deliberately unread.

`e->id` is a raw server entity generation, distinct from entity slot, DBID,
packet ID and Map generation. A matching self create is only wire consistency
against the owned local-development handoff; it does not establish whole-list
uniqueness, authenticated server identity or source dictionary ownership.

The existing `initial-update` diagnostic composes list, control, deletes,
character/global suffix and command tail. It requires an actual costume
dictionary/manifest generation before complete records can be admitted. No Map,
message or session counter can substitute for that generation. All character,
source-generation, actor, ACK and world-authority flags remain false.

## Qualification scope

`check_initial_triggered_probe.py --sanitize --output NEW.json` executes only the
pinned original triggered-move producer on explicit fixture shells, then tests
this added stage in release, ASan and UBSan. Over-limit count controls do not
overrun the retained16-slot fixture shell. The generated JNI fixture verifies
the retained sequence-prefix header and its source-bound receipt, appends actual
original triggered-move output and an opaque AI-animation witness. It does not
execute a complete original ALLENTS transaction or new Thor session.
The affected JNI adapter is checked with explicit controller/JNI doubles for
same-loan composition, refusal reporting and cleanup. Accepted first-create and
pose/sequence tests, plus general renderer/compiler/network/Android13 suites, are not
repeated. Their previous receipts remain source-bound.

The previously reported unsupported Map count is the ordinary successful GROUPS
inspector's deliberate UNSUPPORTED boundary (command6, exact consumed end), which
the capture wrapper continues past. It is not an unidentified failed message.
Gates 25–27 remain open. No new APK is produced for this bounded source step.
